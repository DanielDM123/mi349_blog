        In this blog post, I will be talking about the state flag of Michigan. Well folks, it’s another blue banner flag. We have covered plenty of these types over the course of the U.S. state flags series. It is just some blue bedsheet with the state seal stamped on top of it as if it was some important legal document. At least the Michigan state seal looks somewhat decent, with the symmetry of elk and the moose the left and right. Some history about this flag: it was adopted in 1911, Before then, Michigan had two other state flags. The first, but unofficial, flag was the Brady flag in 1837 when Michigan became a state. It was made from white silk and also included the coat of arms, with a woman and a soldier holding a flintlock musket on each side of the seal. The second flag was adopted in 1865 and first used in San Francisco of all places. It basically had the same design as of today, but just with the old state seal. A neat fact about it was how it had a reverse (back) side of it, with the seal of the executive branch seal on it.

        In this blog post, I will be talking about the state flag of Hawaii. If I had to rank this flag based on a S to F tier, I would probably put this flag a low A tier, high B tier. If it weren’t for the plentiful amount of blue banner flags, I would put it a bit lower, but since Hawaii’s flag is actually unique, I think a low A tier is fair. Now some history about this flag. As you might have noticed, Hawaii’s flag actually includes the Union Jack. This is because, when the British visited the islands, they had made a diplomatic agreement with the King of Hawaii to become a protectorate of the British empire, and thus they adopted the Union Jack as their flag. However, the U.S. was a major trading partner to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and when the War of 1812 broke out, the King decided to remake the flag so it would not offend anyone. This is the flag we still have today. Some facts about the flag itself is that it follows the 1:2 aspect ratio, like most other former British colonies, and the eight stripes on the flag represent each of the major islands of Hawaii.
